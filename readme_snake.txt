The snake movement was a big issue. I spent hours on my own and office 
hours to fix the issues. Moreover, figuring out the grid system was also
a bit of a hassle.

/**********************************************************************
 *  How did you feel about this as a final assignment for CIS 1100?                   
 **********************************************************************/

I feel this assignment should not have a drop option and everyone should
do it because it tests everything we have learnt so far. It taught me on
how to work on big project and organise your work so this was a big learning
experience for me.
        

/**********************************************************************
 *  How do I run the program?                   
 **********************************************************************/

Just run the snakeGame file and the rest of the instructions are written 
on screen. However just to mention, pressing 'space bar' starts the game.
Colliding with the wall or the snake body ends the game. After the game 
ends pressing 'space bar' restarts the game.

/**********************************************************************

My SnakeGame file handles User interface. Basically it displaying
the starting screen and handles restarting of the game. It also manages 
highscore and current score of the game session.

Board file handle drawing the main board. Manages the snake movement of 
the snake. Draws the food on the board, detects collision of the snake
with the wall, food and itself. Grows the snake when a collision occurs
with the food. Also handles game ending.

Snake file draws the snakes and upates the xPosition and yPosition of
the snake.
